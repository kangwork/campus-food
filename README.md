### **Future Development Plan**
1. **Backend Architecture**:  
   - Implement APIs for user authentication, menu retrieval, and order management.  
   - Use a scalable cloud backend (e.g., Firebase, AWS) to support real-time updates.  

2. **Frontend Development**:  
   - Translate the Figma design into a functional app using React Native or Flutter for cross-platform compatibility.  
   - Implement state management for user preferences and real-time order tracking.  

3. **Payment Integration**:  
   - Integrate with Stripe for credit/debit cards and other APIs for campus card payments.  

4. **Testing & Deployment**:  
   - Conduct usability testing to refine workflows.  
   - Deploy the app to App Store and Google Play.
